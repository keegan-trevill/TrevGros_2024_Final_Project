### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    Target User Profile (Persona): 
Name and Position: Alex Jameson; Contributor for the Institute of the Study of War

The following descriptions showcase the uses of Afghan Refugee Displacement Following the US Withdrawal in 2021. Alex is tasked with understanding how the actions of the United States have an effect on foreign born individuals that assisted the United States during the course of a foreign campaign. Since there is a large diaspora of Afghans in both the world and within the US itself, Alex does not have the ability to conduct the empirical research himself to gain a full picture of what the movement of Afghans out of afghanistan looked like. By using the Afghan Displacement Map, Alex can delineate the features on the map in a way to find clusters of where Afghans ended up, but will also notice how spikes play an important role in the journey and can be areas of importance to focus on. With a narrative of the Afghan displacement, Alex will be able to gain new insights of how the USâ€™s decisions have effects on human migration around the world. The Afghan Displacement Map will provide a linear narrative that showcases the movement from Afghanistan and will then branch out into an exploratory map that allows the user to examine the data in its entirety. 
    2. We want to understand how Afghans leaving Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover were disbursed around the world
       and we want to understand what organizations assisted in this crisis.

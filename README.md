### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    Target User Profile (Persona): 
Name and Position: Alex Jameson; Contributor for the Institute of the Study of War

The following descriptions showcase the uses of Afghan Refugee Displacement Following the US Withdrawal in 2021. Alex is tasked with understanding how the actions of the United States have an effect on foreign born individuals that assisted the United States during the course of a foreign campaign. Since there is a large diaspora of Afghans in both the world and within the US itself, Alex does not have the ability to conduct the empirical research himself to gain a full picture of what the movement of Afghans out of afghanistan looked like. By using the Afghan Displacement Map, Alex can delineate the features on the map in a way to find clusters of where Afghans ended up, but will also notice how spikes play an important role in the journey and can be areas of importance to focus on. With a narrative of the Afghan displacement, Alex will be able to gain new insights of how the US’s decisions have effects on human migration around the world. The Afghan Displacement Map will provide a linear narrative that showcases the movement from Afghanistan and will then branch out into an exploratory map that allows the user to examine the data in its entirety. 
    2. We want to understand how Afghans leaving Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover were disbursed around the world
       and we want to understand what organizations assisted in this crisis. 


User Case Scenario

	Scenario #1: Upon reaching the first page of the interactive, the beginning of the Afghanistan refugee data during the Taliban takeover will become notable on a global level. This overview allows the viewer to change the timeline to showcase the amount of and positions where the refugees are traveling to during a given month. As well as this, quantitative data will be showcased on a global scale for the refugee crisis, including where people were traveling to as well as how many. Immediately the user will see the bright streaking colors traveling across the map from positions in Afghanistan towards positions in Europe and America. This will signify movement within the viewer, helping to transmit the message that the refugees had to travel incredible distances quickly. This user, who is located within a specific country decides to click on their home country and a similar page is brought up with more in depth detail. Through this, they can see the same “flight” lines from Afghanistan to their home country, as well as data showcasing the amount of refugees over time, the overall amount per year, and where the refugee’s ended up in their given country. Through this, the user is able to get a global picture of the movement of people, as well as where these people ended up and how many. 

 
	Scenario #2: The second scenario the user will come across within the interactive display is by selecting certain regions. With this, a more micro lens will fall upon the data showcasing either America or Europe and the similar “flight” lines from before. This data enables the user to take a step back on the data while still being able to hone in on certain aspects. In particular, a user wanting data only within the United States will be able to use the interactive display to see the movement of peoples within the US, compared to Europe, countries in Europe, or States in America. These four settings are interchangeable with each other allowing the user to effectively and efficiently compare and contrast different data that has come from the migration of people. As well as this, to hone in on the comparative nature of the data, the landing of the migrants will be showcased on all levels, global, country, and state.
